# Picoprobe
Picoprobe allows a Pico / RP2040 to be used as USB -> SWD and UART bridge. This means it can be used as a debugger and serial console for another Pico.

# Documentation
Picoprobe documentation can be found in the [Pico Getting Started Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf). See "Appendix A: Using Picoprobe".

# TODO
- TinyUSB's vendor interface is FIFO-based and not packet-based. Using raw tx/rx callbacks is preferable as this stops DAP command batches from being concatenated, which confused openOCD.
- Instead of polling, move the DAP thread to an asynchronously started/stopped one-shot operation to reduce CPU wakeups
- AutoBaud selection, as PIO is a capable frequency counter
- Possibly include RTT support
